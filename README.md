# Neighborhood Traffic Monitoring System

A hybrid edge-cloud architecture for monitoring and analyzing traffic patterns on residential streets using a Raspberry Pi with webcam and Google Cloud Platform for data processing.

## Problem Statement

Our residential street has become increasingly dangerous due to high traffic volumes and reckless driving, creating an unsafe environment for residents, pedestrians, and especially children. Despite frequent close calls and community concerns, we lack the quantitative data necessary to compel municipal action for traffic calming measures.

This project systematically collects and analyzes traffic data to build an evidence-based case for implementing traffic calming measures such as speed bumps, enhanced signage, and integrated road design that prioritizes safety for all road users.

## Project Architecture

The system uses a hybrid edge-cloud architecture:

### Edge Component (Raspberry Pi)
- Captures video from webcam
- Performs real-time vehicle detection and counting
- Temporarily stores data locally
- Syncs data to the cloud on a regular schedule
- Operates with fallback mechanisms for connectivity issues

### Cloud Component (Google Cloud Platform)
- Stores the complete dataset
- Performs advanced analytics and processing
- Handles visualization and reporting
- Provides dashboards and APIs for data access
- Scales resources as needed for intensive tasks

```
# Run with visualization (for testing)
python3 src/main.py --config config/config.yaml --display

# Run headless (for deployment)
python3 src/main.py --config config/config.yaml

# Record video samples
python3 src/main.py --config config/config.yaml --record
```

## Using the Data

### Accessing Local Data

The SQLite database (`data/database.sqlite`) contains:
- Individual vehicle detection events
- Hourly and daily aggregate counts

### Accessing Cloud Data

#### BigQuery
- Run queries and analysis on the full dataset
- Create views for common analysis patterns
- Connect to data visualization tools

#### Looker Studio
- Create dashboards for traffic patterns
- Generate visualizations for advocacy
- Share insights with community members

## Data Privacy Considerations

This system is designed to monitor traffic patterns only, not identify individuals:
- No identifying information is collected
- Video is processed for counting and analysis, not surveillance
- Data is anonymized and aggregated
- Installation location should respect community privacy

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the system are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

### Raspberry Pi Issues
- Camera not detected: Verify USB connection and try different ports
- Performance problems: Reduce resolution or FPS in configuration
- Overheating: Ensure adequate ventilation for the Pi

### Cloud Integration Issues
- Authentication errors: Check credentials file and permissions
- Sync failures: Verify internet connection and retry logic
- BigQuery errors: Confirm schema matches between local and cloud
