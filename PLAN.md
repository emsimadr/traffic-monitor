# Traffic Monitoring System: Development Roadmap

## Problem Statement

Our residential street has become increasingly dangerous due to high traffic volumes and reckless driving behavior, creating an unsafe environment for residents, pedestrians, and especially children. Despite frequent close calls and community concerns, we lack the quantitative data necessary to compel municipal action. Current traffic management prioritizes vehicle flow over neighborhood livability, putting vulnerable road users at risk daily.

We need to systematically collect and analyze comprehensive traffic data to build an evidence-based case for implementing traffic calming measures including integrated road design that prioritizes safety for all users. By documenting actual traffic patterns, speeds, pedestrian presence, and dangerous behaviors, we aim to shift the conversation from anecdotal complaints to data-driven solutions that transform our street from a thoroughfare to a livable community space where all road users can safely coexist.

- Identification of the most problematic time periods
- Clear evidence of speed limit violations and their frequency
- Compelling safety case based on documented speeding incidents

## Milestone 3: Pedestrian Detection & Classification
**Goal:** Extend system to monitor pedestrian activity with special classifications

**Benefits Upon Completion:**
- Comprehensive picture of all road users, not just vehicles
- Evidence for pedestrian safety improvements
- Insights into accessibility challenges (wheelchair/stroller usage)
- Data on pedestrian/vehicle interaction patterns
- Support for complete street design advocacy
- Identification of peak pedestrian usage times

- Evidence for creating safe cycling options as part of traffic calming

## Milestone 5: Path Tracking & Heatmap Visualization
**Goal:** Visualize actual vehicle paths to analyze road usage patterns

**Benefits Upon Completion:**
- Visual evidence of actual driving patterns
- Identification of unsafe driving behaviors (e.g., cutting corners)
- Support for road design improvement requests
- Clear visualization of lane discipline issues
- Powerful visual tools for community and authority presentations
- Evidence of how road design affects driving behavior
- Compelling visual narratives that demonstrate risky traffic patterns
- Identification of specific design flaws that contribute to unsafe conditions

## Milestone 6: System Integration & Refinement
**Goal:** Create a robust, integrated system with enhanced analytics

**Benefits Upon Completion:**

- Detailed analysis by vehicle type and impact
- Predictive capabilities for traffic management
- Automatic alerting for unusual traffic situations
- Flexible data access for integration with other systems
- Documentation of how different vehicle types affect neighborhood livability
- Evidence of particularly problematic vehicle classes (e.g., large trucks)

## Milestone 8: Data Presentation & Advocacy
**Goal:** Transform collected data into compelling advocacy tools

**Benefits Upon Completion:**
- Powerful tools for traffic calming advocacy
- Professional-quality presentations for authorities
- Evidence-based approach to community discussions
